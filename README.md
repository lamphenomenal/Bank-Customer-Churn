 Turning Customer Churn into a Growth Strategy | Bank Analytics Case Study

Customer churn is often treated as a reporting metric. In reality, it’s a strategic growth lever.

I recently completed an end-to-end Bank Customer Churn & Segmentation project where I combined exploratory analysis, machine learning, and customer segmentation to answer a core business question:

 Who is leaving, why are they leaving, and what should we do about it?

Key insights from the analysis:

Churn is predictable using customer demographics and account behavior (Random Forest ROC AUC ≈ 0.87)

The strongest churn drivers were Age, Balance concentration, Credit Score, Product count, and Customer engagement

High-balance customers churn more than low-balance customers — a critical value leakage

German customers churn at nearly 2x the rate of French and Spanish customers

Customers naturally cluster into two actionable segments:

Engaged, multi-product users with lower churn

High-balance, low-engagement customers with elevated churn risk

Business outcome:
Rather than stopping at prediction, I translated insights into CMO-ready marketing actions, recommending:

A Digital Growth Bundle to deepen engagement in low-risk customers

A Premier Retention Program to protect high-value, high-risk customers

Market-specific strategies to support European expansion

This project reinforced a key lesson:
The value of analytics isn’t in the model — it’s in the decisions it enables.

Happy to discuss the approach, modeling choices, or how to turn analytics into executive-ready strategy.
